##########
No smoothing of the image. It got decided to smooth the image as a pre-processing step where required but otherwise leave it as it is.

02t2skullstripped
#################
Use: 	BET2 (from FSL) or SPM or cmtk on the T2 image for this.
Save: 	(1) skull-stripped versions of the images in T2 space and (2) the brain-masks in T2 space.

03t2inhomogeneityremoval
########################
Use:	FSL? or are there other possibilities?
Doubts:	Do I have to calculate the bias field for one sequence and then apply it to all OR do it for each sequence individually?
Save:	(1) The bias corrected images in T2 space and (2) the bias field(s) in T2 space

04t2intensitrangestandardization
################################
Use:	My algorithm. For each volume train a intensity-space-model from the images of the same sequence from all other cases and apply it to the current image
Save:	(1) The intensity corrected versions of the images in T2 space
